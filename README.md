### Variables

in go, every data type has a value of 0

### Arrays and Slices  
if you don't specify the size of an array, it becomes a slice  
### Internal Arrays  
when slice overflows the size, go creates another internal array and doubles it  
array a list of fixed size and slice a list without fixed size  
### Maps
key value structure and not a mutable structure  
### If and Else  
start a variable directly in if  
there are no relatives in go  
### Switch
