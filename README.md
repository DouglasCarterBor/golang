### Initial
go mod init modulo  
go build  
go install  
### External Package
go get github.com/badoux/checkmail 
### Remove Unused Packages
go mod tidy  
### Variables
go is strongly typed  
go doesnÂ´t let you import a variable and not use it  
### Data Types
always double quotes for string  
there is no char in go
in go, every data type has a value of 0  
### Functions  
more than one return per function  
### Operators  
in go there is no ternary operator
### Heritage
there is no inheritance in go
### Ponteirs
memory reference  
& put variable in pointer  
\* differentiation  
### Arrays and Slices  
if you don't specify the size of an array, it becomes a slice  
### Internal Arrays  
when slice overflows the size, go creates another internal array and doubles it  
array a list of fixed size and slice a list without fixed size  
### Maps
key value structure and not a mutable structure  
### If and Else  
start a variable directly in if  
there are no relatives in go  
### Switch  
fallthrough  
in go you don't need to use the break clause  
### Loops
go only has for  
you can't use a range in a struct  
### Advanced Functions  
functions with named return  
variatic function  
anonymous functions  
recursive functions  
defer  
panic amd recover  
closure  
functions with pointers  
init  
### Methods  
methods are functions that are associated with user-defined types  
### Interfaces  
implicitly implemented  
### Interface with generic type  
be careful not to turn int into a defective solution  
### Command line application  
receive some inputs via command line 
go mode init command_line_application  
go get github.com/urfave/cli  
go run main.go ip --host mercadolivre.com.br  
go build  
./command_line_application ip --host amazon.com.br  
### Competition  
competition != parallelism  
goroutines  
wait group  
channel  
channel with buffer
